                    To ensure accuracy of our study, we calculated the length of URLs in the dataset and produced an
                    average URL length. The
                    results showed that if the length of the URL is greater than or equal 54 characters then the URL
                    classified as phishing.
                    By reviewing our dataset we were able to find 1220 URLs lengths equals to 54 or more which
                    constitute 48.8% of the total

                    is a method on the “World Wide Web” in which a URL may be made considerably smaller in length and
                    still
                    lead to the required webpage. This is accomplished by means of an “HTTP Redirect” on a domain name
                    that is short, which
                    links to the webpage that has a long URL. For example, the URL “http://portal.hud.ac.uk/” can be
                    shortened to
                    “bit.ly/19DXSk4”.

                    URL’s is: “http://www.legitimate.com//http://www.phishing.com”. We examin the location where the
                    “//” appears. We find
                    that if the URL starts with “HTTP”, that means the “//” should appear in the sixth position.
                    However, if the URL employs
                    “HTTPS” then the “//” should appear in seventh position.

                    by (-) to the
                    domain name so that users feel that they are dealing with a legitimate webpage. For example

                    <summary>7.Having multiple subdomains <span id="suspicious"> :suspicious</span></summary>Let us
                    assume we have the following link: http://www.hud.ac.uk/students/. A domain name might include the
                    country-code
                    top-level domains (ccTLD), which in our example is “uk”. The “ac” part is shorthand for “academic”,
                    the combined “ac.uk”
                    is called a second-level domain (SLD) and “hud” is the actual name of the domain. To produce a rule
                    for extracting this
                    feature, we firstly have to omit the (www.) from the URL which is in fact a sub domain in itself.
                    Then, we have to
                    remove the (ccTLD) if it exists. Finally, we count the remaining dots. If the number of dots is
                    greater than one, then
                    the URL is classified as “Suspicious” since it has one sub domain. However, if the dots are greater
                    than two, it is
                    classified as “Phishing” since it will have multiple sub domains. Otherwise, if the URL has no sub
                    domains, we will
                    assign “Legitimate” to the feature.

                    bar. If the favicon is
                    loaded from a domain other than that shown in the address bar, then the webpage is likely to be
                    considered a Phishing

                    such as
                    PhishTank (PhishTank Stats, 2010-2012), and StopBadware (StopBadware, 2010-2012) formulate
                    numerous statistical reports on phishing websites at every given period of time; some are
                    monthly and others are
                    quarterly. In our research, we used 2 forms of the top ten statistics from PhishTank: “Top 10
                    Domains” and “Top 10 IPs”
                    according to statistical-reports published in the last three years, starting in January2010 to
                    November 2012. Whereas
                    for “StopBadware”, we used “Top 50” IP addresses.
